1) The program runs correctly, it takes in different lengths and outputs
the sorted list in descending order.

2) I could not get number 2 to run correctly. One problem is with the output being not a whole number.
The numbers have to be converted to double or float to output a number with decimal. ANother problem is in 
the solve function. The operators need to follow math rules and do some operators before others in the inputed
string.
