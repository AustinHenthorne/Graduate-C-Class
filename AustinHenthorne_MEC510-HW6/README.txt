I derived a class from the turbine class and added a member function
to calculate the added turbulence intensity, and the total turbulence intensity.
My final answer came out a little different then the one given to us.
But I found that if you use 0.2 as the axial induction factor for the 
second turbine the answer is the one given to us.
