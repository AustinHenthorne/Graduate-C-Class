1) This program is the snakes and ladders game. The game will prompt you to press "ENTER" for
each dice roll. Each roll will show the die number, your new position and if you hit a snake or ladder.

2) This next program calculates the power of the wind turbine (in Watts). The program prompts you to enter the 
wind speeds in all directions (u, v, and w) and also the yaw angle. The wind speeds need to be entered in
m/s and the angle in degrees.
