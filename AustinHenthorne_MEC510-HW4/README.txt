Austin Henthorne MEC510: HW4

This program prints to the screen the: The mean for the x, y and z wind speeds. And the standard
deviations for each mean. I read the data file as a string. I indexed the string for the necessary values i needed
(x, y and z velocities) and converted them to a float and did the necessary math to obtain mean and standard 
deviation. The class consisted of the three member functions in public: read data, compute mean, and
compute standard deviation. The main code just called these three member functions.
